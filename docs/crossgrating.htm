	<h1>Abstract class CrossGrating</h1>
        
        <hr>
	<p>
        The abstract class <b>CrossGrating</b> is used by <a
        href="crossrcwmodel.htm">CrossRCW_Model</a> to describe a
        two-dimensionally periodic grating. A crossed grating is a grating with periodicity along two directions. The diagram below shows a simple two-dimensionally periodic structure (crossed grating), with the 
	grating constants, <tt>d1</tt> and <tt>d2</tt>. The grating directions make an angle <tt>zeta</tt> from perpendicular. 
	<center><a name="crossgrating"></a><img src="Images/crossgrating.jpg" width="500" alt="Top view of a simple crossed grating, showing the unit cell, the grating constants, d1 and d2, and the angle zeta."></center>
	<p>There are several
        instantiable models currently available that inherit
        <b>CrossGrating</b>:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="#oned">OneD_CrossGrating</a>: A cross grating defined by a one dimensional grating, using <a href="grating.htm">Grating</a>.
	<li><a href="#overlay">Overlaid_CrossGrating</a>: A cross grating created by overlaying two other cross gratings.
	<li><a href="#overlay1d">Overlaid_1D_CrossGrating</a>: A cross grating created by overlaying two 1D gratings at a given angle.
        <li><a href="#nullgrating">Null_CrossGrating</a>: A trivial grating consisting of no features.
	  </ul>

	 <p>A number of <b>CrossGrating</b>s inherit the properties of <b>Gridded_CrossGrating</b>, an abstract class that 
	    handles the Fourier factorization of the grating structure on a grid:

	<ul>
	<li><a href="#generic">Generic_CrossGrating</a>: A crossed grating described by a <a href="#file">grating description file</a>. 
	      This description is the most general and can describe a wide variety of crossed gratinged with sharp material boundaries.
	<li><a href="#Cylinder_CrossGrating">Cylinder_CrossGrating</a>: A cross grating described by an array of vertical cylinders.
	<li><a href="#Rectangular_CrossGrating">Rectangular_CrossGrating</a>: A binary grating consisting of rectangles or parallelograms.
	<li><a href="#Sphere_CrossGrating">Sphere_CrossGrating</a>: A cross grating described by an array of spheres embeded in a medium.
	<li><a href="#Pyramidal_Pit_CrossGrating">Pyramidal_Pit_CrossGrating</a>: A cross grating described by an array of tetrahedral pits.
	</ul>
	<p>The <b>CrossGrating</b>s that inherit <b>Gridded_CrossGrating</b> discretize the dielectric function on a uniform grid. These gratings are therefore approximations of the desired grating, and the 
	  results of <a href="crossrcwmodel.htm">CrossRCW_Model</a> may not be continuous in the grating parameters.

	<h3>File format for Generic_CrossGrating</h3>

        <blockquote><p> This section describes the file format
        required by <b>Generic_CrossGrating</b>. The file is a text
        file. We will illustrate the format of the file using an
        example grating structure, shown below.  Dimensions are
        generic and parameters can be passed to the model at a later
        time using the <b>pstring</b> parameter.  It is recommended
        that users familiarize themselves with the <a href="grating.htm#file">description for one
        dimensional gratings (in Generic_Grating)</a> before moving on
        to two dimensional gratings.  The grating description for a
        cross grating is very similar to that for a one dimensional
        grating.  Instead of defining coordinates in two dimensions,
        with line segments separating regions, a two-dimensional
        grating requires coordinates in three dimensions, with
        polygons separating regions.  While quite complicated structures can be described in this file format, the example we give below 
        is fairly simple.  We will consider a
        two-dimensional array of tetrahedral pits in a surface.  A
        top-down view of this structure is shown below:
              
	  <center>
               <img src=
                "Images/FileCrossGrating.gif" alt=
                "A diagram showing a structure with dimensions, materials, and vertices labeled.">
             </center>

	  <p>The solid black lines above denote the structure.  The heavy
	  black dashed parallelogram denotes the unit cell. The
	  dimensions of the structure are given by the parameters <b>P</b>
	  (for the unit cell side length), <b>L</b> (the base of the
	  tetrahedrons), and <b>D</b> (the depth of the tetrahedrons).  We assume for
	  simplicity that the parallelogram is tilted by 30&deg; (inner
	  angles of 60&deg; and 120&deg;).

	  <p>Like the grating description file for one-dimensional
	  gratings, the grating description file for two-dimensional
	  gratings is a plain-text file.  In order to differentiate
	  the two-dimensional grating from the one-dimensional grating
	  description, the first word of the file must be
	  <b>CROSSGRATING</b> for the two-dimensional grating.  There
	  are five blocks (<b>PARAMETERS</b>, <b>WORKING</b>,
	  <b>MATERIALS</b>, <b>VERTICES</b>, and <b>BOUNDARIES</b>, in
	  that order) of data in the file, and each begins with the
	  name of the block and ends with the word <b>END</b>. In the
	  following, the five blocks are described. In the text file,
	  these blocks of data are listed consecutively and in
	  order. Comments can be located anywhere in the file, are
	  delimited by a semicolon (;), and run to the end of the
	  line. Except insofar as linefeeds mark the end of comments,
	  linefeeds can be placed anywhere in the file.  The
	  <b>PARAMETERS</b> section is essentially identical to that
	  for a one-dimensional grating.  In our example we would use
	  (including the <b>CROSSGRATING</b> statement):

	  <pre>
	  CROSSGRATING

          PARAMETERS
	        L     ; Length of base of pyramid
	        P     ; Length of unit cell (pitch)
	        D     ; Depth of pyramid
          END
          </pre>

	  <h4>WORKING Section:</h4>

	  <p>The <b>WORKING</b> section is also essentially identical to that
	  for a one-dimensional grating.  The parameters <b>zeta</b>, <b>d1</b>, <b>d2</b>, and <b>lambda</b> 
	  are predefined by the values given in the class parameters.  However, <b>zeta</b>, <b>d1</b>, and <b>d2</b> can be overridden in the <b>WORKING</b> section.  The value <b>zeta</b> 
	  is the angle (in degrees) that the
	  unit cell is tilted from rectangular (see figure above, a rectangular lattice has <b>zeta</b> equal to 0&deg;).
	  The lattice constants are <b>d1</b> and <b>d2</b>, where <b>d1</b> is in
	  the <i>x</i> (horizontal) direction, and <b>d2</b> is
	  the other lattice constant.  The wavelength of the light is <b>lambda</b> and is assigned by <a href="crossrcwmodel.htm">CrossRCW_Model</a>.

	    <p>In our example, we might use:
	    <pre>
         WORKING
	     x1   0
	     x6   L*cosd(60)
	     x3   P*cosd(60)
	     x5   L
	     x2   P
	     x4   x3+P
	     x7   x6

	     y1   0
	     y2   0
	     y5   0
	     y7   L/2*tand(30)
	     y6   L*sind(60)
	     y3  P*sind(60)
	     y4   y3

	     z1   0
	     z2   0
	     z3   0
	     z4   0
	     z5   0
	     z6   0
	     z7   -D

	     d1   P
	     d2   P
	     zeta 30
         END
          </pre>

	    In our example, <tt>x6</tt> is the <i>x</i> coordinate of vertex <tt>v6</tt> in the diagram. One in not required to use this scheme for defining the 
	    working variables; the author simply finds this scheme convenient when defining complex gratings.

	  <h4>MATERIALS Section:</h4>

	  <p>The <b>MATERIALS</b> section is also essentially identical to that
	  for <a href="grating.htm#file">Generic_Grating</a>. 
	    As for the one-dimensional
	  grating, the two materials <b>medium_i</b> and <b>medium_t</b> are
	    predefined and determined by the class parameters.
	    Thus, for this simple grating, where we have no
	  other materials, we would just use:

	    <pre>
            MATERIALS
            END
            </pre>

	    Like the <a href="grating.htm#file">Generic_Grating</a>, the keywords <b>ANISO</b>, <b>MAGNETIC</b>, and <b>ANISOMAGNETIC</b> can be used
	    for anisotropic, magnetic, and anisotropic magnetic media.  For cross gratings, when <b>zeta</b> is nonzero, the axes of the anisotropic
	    media are the same as the unit cell vectors.
	    
	    
	  <h4>VERTICES Section:</h4>

	  <p>The <b>VERTICES</b> section is similar to that for a
	  <a href="grating.htm#file">Generic_Grating</a>, except that all vertices must have
	  three coordinates, instead of two. The three coordinates, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> form a right-handed coordinate system, with <i>x</i> along the <b>d1</b> side of the unit cell, and <i>z</i> pointing from
	  the <b>medium_t</b> to <b>medium_i</b>. For our example, we
	  would use: 

	    <pre>
            VERTICES 
                  v1   (x1,y1,z1) 
                  v2   (x2,y2,z2) 
                  v3   (x3,y3,z3) 
                  v4   (x4,y4,z4)
                  v5   (x5,y5,z5) 
                  v6   (x6,y6,z6) 
                  v7   (x7,y7,z7) 
            END
            </pre>
	    
	    <p>Except for defining <tt>d1</tt>, <tt>d2</tt>, and <tt>zeta</tt>, we could have left out most of the variables in the <b>WORKING</b> section and defined the vertices by

	    <pre>
            VERTICES 
                  v1   (0,0,0) 
                  v2   (P,0,0) 
                  v3   (P*cosd(60),P*sind(60),0) 
                  v4   (P*cosd(60)+P,P*sind(60),0)
                  v5   (0,L,0) 
                  v6   (L*cosd(60),L*sind(60),0) 
                  v7   (L*cosd(60),L*sind(60),-D) 
            END
	    </pre>

	    <p>However, for a much more complicated grating, such a description can get very tedious.

	  <h4>BOUNDARIES Section:</h4>

	  <p>The <b>BOUNDARIES</b> section, like that for the one-dimensional
	  grating, is used to define all of the boundaries between
	  materials.  Unlike a one-dimensional grating, the boundaries
	  must be defined with facets, rather than with line segments.
	  There are two types of facets that are allowed: triangles
	  and convex quadrangles.  The convex quadrangles are further
	  subdivided by the software into triangles, but are included
	  to make some grating definitions easier.  To define a
	  triangle, for example, the one with vertices <b>v1</b>, <b>v5</b>, and <b>v7</b>,
	  we would use:

	    <pre>
	       v1  v5  v7  material_t  material_i
            </pre>

	  <p>That is, we list the three vertices, followed by the two
	  materials.  The order of the materials must correspond to
	  the ordering of the vertices using a right-handed
	  convention.  That is, as one goes from the first vertex to
	  the second vertex and then to the third vertex, with a right
	  hand, the thumb will point from the first material to the
	  second material.  Reversing the two materials will create an
	  error.

	  <p>For a convex quadrangle, we use the flag <b>QUAD</b>, followed
	  by four vertices, and followed again by the two materials.
	  For example, the quadrangle defined by <b>v5</b>, <b>v2</b>, <b>v3</b>, and <b>v6</b>
	  (see light dashed blue line in the figure above), we would
	  use:

	    <pre>
	        QUAD  v5  v2  v3  v6  material_t  material_i
            </pre>

	  <p>The vertices must be listed according to adjacent
	  vertices on the quadrangle, and the right-hand rule is used
	  for the ordering of the materials.  Note that the quadrangle
	  is divided into two triangles.  Thus, the above <b>QUAD</b>
	  statement is equivalent to

	    <pre>
	        v5  v2  v3  material_t  material_i
	        v2  v3  v6  material_t  material_i
            </pre>

	  <p>For that reason, it is best to ensure that all
	  quadrangles are convex.  That is, no internal angles of the
	  quadrangles should be greater than 180&deg;.  Furthermore, it is best to use the <b>QUAD</b> 
	  designation only for vertices that are co-planar.

	    <p>Thus, for the above structure, the <b>BOUNDARIES</b> section would be:

	    <pre>
                BOUNDARIES
	              v1  v5  v7  material_t  material_i
	              v7  v5  v6  material_t  material_i
	              v1  v7  v6  material_t  material_i
	              QUAD  v5  v2  v3  v6  material_t  material_i
	              v2  v4  v3  material_t  material_i
                END
            </pre>

	  <p>All boundaries within the unit cell must be defined.  Any
	  line passing in the z direction must pass consistently
	  through boundaries, starting below the grating with
	  <b>material_t</b> and ending above the grating with <b>material_i</b>.
	  Any line passing in the x or y directions must pass
	  consistently through boundaries, starting and ending with
	  the same material.  If a vertical boundary exists on the
	  edge of the unit cell, then one should only specify the
	  boundary on one side.
